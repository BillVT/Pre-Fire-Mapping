Version 1.0

Authors:
    William Etter (MSE '11)

Introduction:
This system utilizes a Hokuyo LIDAR Laser Rangefinder mounted on a handheld unit to scan a location and save the data to a flashdrive. This data is then uploaded to the base station where the SLAM algorithm (run in ROS - Robot Operating System). From here the scanned area (rooms, floors, buildings) can be visualized and input to other programs such as 3D modelings and building databases.
Components

This system utilzies the following subsystems and components:
    Remote System (Handheld Scanning Unit):
    -Hokuyo URG-04LX-UG01(Simple-URG)
    -BeagleBone (Low-cost, fan-less single board computer) with custom Linux install
    -CHR-6dm Inertial Measurement Unit
    -4D uLCD-32PTGFX 3.2" TFT Touchscreen LCD Display
